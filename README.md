## 👨‍🎓 About Me

Hello! I’m **Ashith Fernandes**, a postgraduate student pursuing **M.Sc. Software Technology** at  
📍 _St Aloysius College (Deemed to be University), AIMIT – Mangaluru, India_.

This project is part of my college record submission to demonstrate core Angular concepts and frontend development using modern tools and frameworks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AngularApp** is a starter project built with Angular CLI, showcasing the use of components, modules, routing, and reactive features of Angular.  
It acts as a solid base for building larger applications like SPAs (Single Page Applications), admin dashboards, or PWA (Progressive Web Apps).

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- ⚙️ [Angular](https://angular.io/) – Component-based frontend framework
- 📜 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – Strongly typed JavaScript superset
- 🔄 [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) – Reactive programming for asynchronous events
- 🔧 [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) – Tooling to develop and scaffold Angular apps
